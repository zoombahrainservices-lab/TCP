# Map marker assets (sprite-based)

Place these images here so the chapter map markers render correctly. Export as **transparent WebP** (or PNG).

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `pedestal_base.webp` | 3D platform (purple) without energy ring — 220×220 or proportional |
| `pedestal_ring.webp` | Glowing rim ring (purple glow) as separate overlay — 220×220 |
| `book_open.webp` | Open book (completed/unlocked state) — 220×220 |
| `book_half.webp` | Half-open book (current state) — 220×220 |
| `book_closed.webp` | Closed book (locked state) — 220×220 |

**Sourcing:** Commission a designer, export from Blender/Figma/Illustrator, or use a consistent asset pack. The map uses `GameMarker` + CSS (sweep, ring breath, float) for the illustrated look.
