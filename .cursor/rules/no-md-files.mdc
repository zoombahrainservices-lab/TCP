# CRITICAL RULES FOR TCP PLATFORM

## 1. NEVER CREATE .md FILES
**NEVER EVER create any .md (markdown) files unless user EXPLICITLY says "create a markdown file"**

- ❌ NO README.md
- ❌ NO documentation files
- ❌ NO guide files
- ❌ NO summary files
- ✅ Just implement features and explain in chat if needed

## 2. COPY DUOLINGO UX - DON'T INVENT
**This platform is a DUOLINGO COPYCAT for communication skills**

### Copy These Duolingo Patterns:
- ✅ Progress bars and streaks
- ✅ Simple, clean UI with gamification
- ✅ One question/task per screen
- ✅ Green checkmarks for correct/completed
- ✅ XP points and achievements
- ✅ Daily goals and reminders
- ✅ Lesson structure: small chunks, immediate feedback
- ✅ Mobile-first, thumb-friendly buttons
- ✅ Encouraging messages ("Great job!", "Keep going!")
- ✅ Simple animations (slide in/out, fade, scale)

### DON'T Invent:
- ❌ Don't create complex new UX patterns
- ❌ Don't overcomplicate interactions
- ❌ Don't add fancy features Duolingo doesn't have
- ❌ Don't "reinvent hot water"

### When Building:
1. Ask yourself: "How does Duolingo do this?"
2. Copy that approach
3. Adapt to communication skills content
4. Keep it SIMPLE

## 3. MOBILE-FIRST ALWAYS
- Design for 375px width first
- Big, thumb-reachable buttons (min 44px)
- Clear, obvious CTAs
- No tiny text or controls

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION OVER DOCUMENTATION
- Build working features
- Use inline comments if needed
- Explain in chat, don't document in files
