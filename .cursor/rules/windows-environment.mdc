# Windows Environment & Shell Rules

- Always assume the user is on **Windows** (PowerShell) unless explicitly stated otherwise.
- **Do not use Linux-specific shell commands** like `ls`, `rm`, `cat`, `touch`, `grep`, `chmod`, etc.
- When commands are necessary, prefer **cross-platform** ones such as:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`
  - `npm run test`
- For **file operations** (read, write, delete, search, list), use the Cursor tools (`Read`, `ApplyPatch`, `LS`, `Grep`, etc.), *not* OS commands.
- Never assume a Unix-style file system layout or paths. When showing paths, use the ones from the user's workspace (e.g. `c:\\Users\\Farzeen\\Desktop\\TCP\\tcp-platform`).
- If a shell command might behave differently on Windows, explain it briefly and avoid running it unless the user explicitly asks for it.
